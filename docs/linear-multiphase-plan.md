# Multi-Phase Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Structure
- Rename increments to playful terms (e.g. thingamabobs, whosits).
- Replace minimal labels with themed text.
- Add a short, fun description for each increment.

## Phase 2: Tiered Progression
- Unlock new increment tiers at certain thresholds.
- Scale each tier’s costs and production differently.
- Require a certain number of lower-tier purchases to unlock higher tiers.

## Phase 3: Upgrades & Multipliers
- Introduce upgrades that increase production or reduce costs.
- Add cross-interactions (e.g., owning X of one tier boosts others).
- Use “funny” names for upgrades.

## Phase 4: Visual & UX
- Present items or upgrades as a “shop” list with short descriptors.
- Highlight purchased upgrades with subtle animations.
- Show a glow or bounce effect when a major milestone is reached.

## Phase 5: Balancing & Iteration
- Adjust cost curves and multipliers for balanced pacing.
- Test for gameplay flow; tweak if players stall or progress too fast.
- Avoid prestige but think of a fun end game that keeps it within the mechanic.
