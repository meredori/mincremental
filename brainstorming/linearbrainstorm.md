The linear incremental should be more like a mini version of adventure capitalist/cookie clicker. Rather than programatically creating new buttons it should have a progression of things you can level up to generate resources, it should have upgrades which will give bonuses to certain buttons (1% per button purchased, double production for button, etc) including cross interactions, similar to how grandma's in cookie clicker have a large amount of multipliers from other upgrades. I think the upgrade progression should be funny thingsmajig names, whosits and whatsits and thingamabobs and doohickies, etc. So you need to make thingos and each one makes a different amount of thingos
